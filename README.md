## Digital Image Watermarking

![Webinar](https://github.com/azizoglu/LSBWatermarking/blob/main/assets/webinar.png?raw=true)

We presented an instructive webinar on "Digital Image Watermarking" at the invitation of Zamzam University. In my presentation, we talked about many topics such as digital image watermarking applications, requirements, classifications, attacks and performance evaluation metrics. At the end of the presentation, we hide a watermark in the Lena image using the Least Significant Bit technique, which is widely used in digital watermarking methods. We evaluated the watermarking method using performance metrics such as PSNR and MSE. Additionally, we assessed the robustness of our watermarking method via a variety of attacks. You can access the code we have developed in the presentation in this repository.

## Recommendation

Also, if you are interested in the topic of digital image watermarking, you can access my paper "A novel reversible fragile watermarking in DWT domain for tamper localization and digital image authentication". In this paper, you can find the details of a reversible and fragile watermarking method that I have proposed.
